# dots-and-boxes
Dots and Boxes game for 2-4 players made in C with [raylib library](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

## About the code
This game was originally made for a University project almost 2 years ago with [raylib v3.7.0](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/tag/3.7.0) in CodeBlocks.  
Recently I decided to come back to this code, make some corrections/improvements and port it to [raylib v4.5](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/tag/4.5.0).  
Also this time I used [raylib VSCode template project](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master/projects/VSCode), so files in the *.vscode* folder, *Makefiles* and *main.code-workspace* were made by 
[raysan5](https://github.com/raysan5) and I made a couple of changes.

## What you need
This game requires [raylib v4.5](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/tag/4.5.0).  
I recommend downloading [raylib with installer and mingw compiler](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/download/4.5.0/raylib_installer_v4.5.mingw.64bit.exe).

## How to play
Everything is explained on the first screen of the game :)  
After pressing ENTER, you choose number of players by pressing the 2, 3 or 4 key.
